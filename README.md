# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project was developed as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning course by Zero to Mastery (ZTM).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes. The project involved several key steps:

**Problem Definition**: Can we predict heart disease based on clinical parameters?

**Data Collection**: The dataset used is sourced from the Cleveland database available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was obtained in a formatted way from Kaggle.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the dataset and discover meaningful patterns.

**Modeling**: Three different models were tested: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.

**Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the models to achieve optimal performance.



## Key Results

### The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, but all models were assessed for various strengths and weaknesses.**

***Technologies Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
